#Task suggestions
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, use statistical analysis - mean, max, min etc.
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate
